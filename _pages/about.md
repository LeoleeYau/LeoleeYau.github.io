I hold a Ph.D. and am currently engaged in postdoctoral research. I have published multiple papers in esteemed journals such as IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) and ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM). My research interests include software engineering and security, with a particular focus on Android malware detection and model interpretability. I am at the forefront of enhancing the detection capabilities and explainability of systems in these areas. I am fortunate to have been mentored by Professor Tao Zhang, a renowned expert in the field.
